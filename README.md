# Heart-Failure-Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict the risk of heart failure in patients using a machine learning 
model built in KNIME. By analysing medical data, this project aims to identify patients at 
higher risk of heart failure, which could allow for earlier interventions and better treatment 
outcomes. KNIME Analytics Platform is an open-source software that allows users to access, 
blend, analyse, and visualize data, without any coding. Its low-code, no-code interface offers 
an easy introduction for beginners, and an advanced data science set of tools for experienced 
users.

The dataset used in this project includes patient information, such as age, sex, blood pressure, 
cholesterol levels, and other health-related metrics. Key attributes are: 
1. Age: The age of the patient in years. 
2. Anaemia: Indicates if the patient has anaemia, a condition marked by a lower-than-normal 
count of red blood cells. 
3. Creatinine Phosphokinase: Measures the level of an enzyme in the blood, often associated 
with heart muscle damage. 
4. Diabetes: Indicates if the patient has diabetes. 
5. Ejection Fraction: The percentage of blood that leaves the heart with each contraction, an 
important metric in assessing heart function. 
6. High Blood Pressure: Indicates if the patient has high blood pressure. 
Platelets: The count of platelets in the blood, which plays a role in clotting. 
7. Serum Creatinine: Measures the level of creatinine in the blood, which helps assess kidney 
function. 
8. Serum Sodium: The level of sodium in the blood, which can impact heart function. 
9.  Sex: The gender of the patient, where 1 represents male and 0 represents female.
10.Smoking: Indicates if the patient is a smoker. 
11.Time: The period of observation for each patient, usually in days. 
12.DEATH_EVENT: The target class or outcome, where 1 indicates the patient experienced 
heart failure, and 0 indicates a normal outcome.
